# Rosewood
Rosewood Game Engine

**Rosewood Engine** is a game engine created for learning purposes. The base of the engine loosely is based of [The Cherno's Game Engine series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) although is highly customized to my own interests, needs.

# Plan
My plan for this engine is to develop it to a point I can make an advanced 2D game and a simple 3D game with it, whilst learning Game Engine development, Design patterns, graphics programming, Advanced c++, problem solving.

# Features
* OpenGL Support
* Graphics API abstractions
* Cross-Platform (Tested on major desktop platforms)
* *Fast* Sprite / Quad Batcher
* Simple Asset / content manager and library
* Event system

# Goals / To-do
* Implement sound library
* Serialization
* Text rendering
* Particle rendering
* Primitive rendering (~~Circle~~, Triangle, ~~Quad~~, Line, Function / curve)
* Implement ECS
* Support DX11, Vulkan and Metal
* Asset importer application
* Level editor / IDE
* Shader cross-compilation
* Deferred Renderer
* Physics support
* Multi-threading
